Problem Statement:

Knights Dialer problem:
-----------------------

Find the number of 30 digit phone numbers that could be dialled using a normal keypad by following the below conditions:

1. All the numbers start with 1
2. From any number the next number should be in knights position. ex: from 1 --> only 6,8 are the potential next digits.

  1   2   3
  4   5   6
  7   8   9
  *   0   #


Solution:
---------

1. It might seem like there is only exponential solution. But we should remeber that we do not want to list the phone numbers, just count them.
2. There is an interesting O(D) solution where D is the number of digits in the phone number.
